# (Optionals) Exclude directories / files from the index
#exclusions:
  # Exclusion via a simple string search in the full path of the file / directory.
  # If any of the given strings are found in the full path, it wont be added to the index.
  # Usually faster than a regular expression!
#  partial_paths:
#    - ".DS_Store"
#    - "._.DS_Store"

  # Exclusion via testing if a regular expression matches the full path of the file / directory.
  # If any of the regular expression matches, it wont be added to the index.
  # Usually slower than using a simple string search.
#  regular_expressions:
#    - "\.Trash-\d+"
